## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While building this component, I practiced:

- Using CSS Grid to lay out two-column content similar to a table

- Structuring CSS into multiple files to make it more readable

- Using the ::marker pseudo-element to style bullet points in unordered lists and numbers in ordered lists

- Using padding-left to adjust the distance between the marker and the list item content

Here's a small snippet I'm proud of:

```css
.row {
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-stone-150);

  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Using CSS Grid to lay out entire pages
